# School_Analysis_Challenge



## Project Overview
There was evidence of academic dishonesty in reading and math grades for Thomas High school Ninth grade. The extent to the dishonesty cannot be ascertain and the math and reading grades for the ninth grade of Thomas High School will be nullified.

The aim of the project is to find out the effects of omitting the math and reading grades on the school analysis.

The school district metrics are as follows:
*	District Summary affected
*	School Summary affected 
*	Thomas High School Performance in relation to other schools
*	Math and Reading scores by grade
*	Scores by school spending
*	Scores by school size
*	Scores by school type

## School Analysis Summary

From the analysis, the following were being measured in regards to the school metrics:

1. Average Math Score
2. Average Reading Score
3. % Passing Math
4. % Passing Reading
5. % Overall Passing

The above measurements changed when Thomas High School 9th Graders grades were omitted. Although the changes were slight, it did not have very significant impact to the analysis or the results.
